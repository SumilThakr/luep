# Land use emissions processor

Process-based models for estimating net pollutant emissions tied to land use, with submodules for:
- windblown dust
- soil NOx
- biogenic VOCs
- deposition of primary PM2.5 from vegetation.

TODO:
- agricultural NH3
- biomass burning
- land clearing

These models explicitly take (harmonized) land use as inputs, to facilitate understanding how
changes in land use affect changes in emissions.
